## Abstract

This report presents experimental results comparing different layer pattern configurations in a hybrid Transformer-Mamba architecture for language modeling. We evaluated five distinct patterns using identical training configurations to understand the impact of layer arrangement on model performance. Our findings reveal that pure attention architectures achieve the best validation performance, while hybrid patterns show promising trade-offs between performance and computational efficiency.

## 1. Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have traditionally relied on Transformer architectures with self-attention mechanisms. Recent developments in State Space Models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, offer alternative approaches with potentially better computational efficiency for long sequences. This study investigates hybrid architectures that combine both paradigms to leverage their respective strengths.

### 3.2 Key Findings

#### 3.2.1 Performance Ranking
1. **Pure Attention (AAAAAAAA)**: Best overall performance with lowest validation loss (5.960) and perplexity (387.72)
2. **Attention-first Alternating (AMAMAMAM)**: Second best with competitive performance
3. **Mamba-first Alternating (MAMAMAMA)**: Close third, minimal difference from AMAMAMAM
4. **Blocked Pattern (MMMMAAAA)**: Moderate performance degradation
5. **Pure SSM (MMMMMMMM)**: Lowest performance but highest parameter count

#### 3.2.2 Computational Efficiency

**Training Speed Analysis:**
- **Pure Attention**: Fastest training (495K tokens/sec) - 2.5x faster than pure SSM
- **Hybrid Patterns**: Moderate speed (~280K tokens/sec)
- **Pure SSM**: Slowest training (194K tokens/sec)

**Memory Efficiency:**
- **Pure Attention**: Most memory efficient (5.60 GB)
- **Hybrid Patterns**: Moderate memory usage (6.17-6.52 GB)
- **Pure SSM**: Highest memory usage (7.01 GB)

### 3.3 Training Dynamics

#### 3.3.1 Learning Curves

All models showed consistent learning patterns:
- Rapid initial loss reduction in first 500 steps
- Gradual improvement from steps 500-1500
- Stabilization in final 1500 steps
- No significant overfitting observed

#### 3.3.2 Gradient Behavior

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Architecture Analysis

#### 4.1.1 Pure Attention Superiority

The pure attention model (AAAAAAAA) demonstrated superior performance across all metrics:
- **Best validation loss**: 5.960 vs. 6.232 for pure SSM (4.4% improvement)
- **Highest training speed**: 2.5x faster than pure SSM
- **Most memory efficient**: 20% less memory than pure SSM

This suggests that for the given task and model size, attention mechanisms are more effective than SSM layers.

#### 4.1.2 Hybrid Pattern Insights

**Alternating Patterns**: Both MAMAMAMA and AMAMAMAM showed similar performance, indicating that the starting layer type has minimal impact. However, AMAMAMAM (attention-first) slightly outperformed MAMAMAMA (Mamba-first).

**Blocked Pattern**: MMMMAAAA showed degraded performance compared to alternating patterns, suggesting that layer diversity throughout the network is beneficial.

#### 4.1.3 Pure SSM Limitations

The pure SSM model (MMMMMMMM) showed several limitations:
- Highest parameter count (26.3M) but worst performance
- Slowest training speed
- Highest memory consumption
- This suggests SSM layers may be less parameter-efficient for this task scale

### 4.2 Implications for Architecture Design

1. **Attention Dominance**: For models of this scale (~25M parameters), pure attention remains superior
2. **Hybrid Benefits**: While not achieving best performance, hybrid patterns offer reasonable trade-offs
3. **Layer Ordering**: Attention-first patterns slightly outperform Mamba-first arrangements
4. **Memory-Performance Trade-off**: Pure attention offers the best balance

### 4.3 Limitations and Future Work

#### 4.3.1 Study Limitations

- **Scale**: Limited to ~25M parameter models; results may not generalize to larger scales
- **Training Duration**: 3,000 steps may be insufficient for full convergence
- **Dataset**: Single domain (cosmopedia-v2) may not represent diverse language modeling tasks
- **Hardware**: Single GPU experiments limit generalizability

#### 4.3.2 Future Research Directions

1. **Scale Studies**: Investigate patterns at 100M+ parameter scales
2. **Longer Training**: Extended training to assess long-term convergence
3. **Domain Diversity**: Multi-domain evaluation
4. **Advanced Patterns**: More sophisticated hybrid arrangements
5. **Efficiency Analysis**: Detailed FLOPS and latency measurements

## 5. Conclusions

This experimental study provides valuable insights into hybrid Transformer-Mamba architectures:

### 5.1 Key Conclusions

1. **Pure attention architectures outperform hybrid and pure SSM configurations** at the 25M parameter scale
2. **Hybrid patterns offer viable alternatives** with moderate performance trade-offs
3. **Attention-first arrangements** show slight advantages over Mamba-first patterns
4. **Computational efficiency favors attention mechanisms** for both training speed and memory usage
5. **Pure SSM architectures are least efficient** for this scale and task

### 5.2 Practical Recommendations

- **For optimal performance**: Use pure attention architectures
- **For research exploration**: Hybrid patterns provide interesting trade-offs
- **For efficiency**: Pure attention offers best speed/memory balance
- **For experimentation**: Attention-first hybrid patterns (AMAMAMAM) show promise

### 5.3 Broader Impact

These findings contribute to the understanding of hybrid neural architectures and inform design decisions for efficient language models. While pure attention remains superior at this scale, hybrid approaches may prove valuable at larger scales or for specific applications requiring the unique properties of state space models.
