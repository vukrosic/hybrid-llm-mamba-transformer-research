## Architecture Analysis

### ü•™ **Sandwich Patterns (Best Performance)**
The sandwich architecture with attention layers at boundaries (`AMMMMMMA`) achieved the best performance. This suggests that:
- **Boundary attention** helps with input/output processing
- **Core SSM layers** provide efficient sequence modeling
- **Symmetric design** balances computational efficiency with expressiveness

### üîÑ **Alternating Patterns (Good Performance)**
Both alternating patterns performed well:
- **A-first (`AMAMAMAM`)**: 779.85 perplexity
- **M-first (`MAMAMAMA`)**: 783.49 perplexity

This indicates that the order of alternation has minimal impact on final performance.

### üìà **Increasing Attention Patterns**
The `MMMMAAA` pattern (increasing attention with depth) performed moderately well (818.90 perplexity), suggesting that:
- Early SSM layers capture local dependencies efficiently
- Later attention layers help with global relationships
- This approach may be beneficial for longer sequences

### üéØ **Pure Architectures (Baseline)**
- **Pure Mamba (SSM)**: 821.83 perplexity - Surprisingly competitive
- **Pure Transformer**: 1143.56 perplexity - Worst performing

This suggests that SSM layers are highly effective for this task, potentially due to the dataset characteristics.

## Training Dynamics

### ‚ö° **Convergence Patterns**
- Most models showed consistent loss reduction
- Validation loss typically improved from ~7.4 to ~6.6
- Training was stable with no catastrophic failures

### üìè **Model Size Efficiency**
- **Smallest**: Pure Transformer (23.6M parameters)
- **Largest**: Pure Mamba (26.3M parameters)
- **Hybrid models**: 24.4M - 26.2M parameters

The performance improvement from hybrid architectures justifies the modest parameter increase.

## Recommendations

### üöÄ **Immediate Actions**
1. **Deploy the sandwich architecture** (`AMMMMMMA`) as the primary model
2. **Investigate longer training** for the best patterns (current: 300 steps)
3. **Scale up** the sandwich pattern to larger models

### üî¨ **Future Research Directions**
1. **Layer depth scaling**: Test 12L and 16L versions of top patterns
2. **Attention ratio optimization**: Fine-tune the attention-to-SSM ratio
3. **Task-specific patterns**: Investigate if patterns vary by task type
4. **Efficiency analysis**: Measure FLOPs and memory usage per pattern

### üìä **Monitoring & Evaluation**
1. **Longer sequences**: Test on sequences longer than current max length
2. **Domain adaptation**: Evaluate on different text domains
3. **Inference speed**: Measure real-world deployment performance
4. **Data uniqueness**: With 50k documents, 10k steps will use unique data

## Technical Details

## Conclusion

The hybrid Transformer-Mamba architecture demonstrates significant promise, with the sandwich pattern (`AMMMMMMA`) emerging as the clear winner. The results suggest that:

1. **Hybrid architectures** consistently outperform pure approaches
